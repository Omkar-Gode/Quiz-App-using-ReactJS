# Quiz App in React JS

1. This App is made in React JS, which fetches data from an external API.
2. Here I created my own JSON server for serving data using "JSON server" package.
3. This is a Typical Quiz App in which you have to guess answer out of four options which at the end gives results.
4. Used useReducer Hook for managing states in this app.
5. I have provided data in "JSON" format for the App.

That's All, Thanks!!

Here are some screenshots of the app..
